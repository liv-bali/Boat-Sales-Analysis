# Boat-Sales-Analysis
## Project Summary
This repository provides an in-depth exploratory analysis of boat sales data, focusing on uncovering key features that draw constumers towards certain boat types. This project aims to uncover key factors influencing boat prices by analyzing relationships between price and characteristics such as year of manufacture, material, dimensions, and market trends. Through hypothesis testing and exploratory analysis, the findings will provide actionable insights for boat buyers, sellers, and manufacturers to make data-driven decisions in the competitive boating market.
## Key Questions  
- Pricing Trends: How have boat prices changed over time? Are there noticeable trends or patterns in pricing?
- Year of Manufacture: Is there a relationship between the year a boat was built and its price? Do newer boats tend to command higher prices?
- Material Influence: How does the material of a boat (e.g., fiberglass, wood, aluminum) affect its price? Are certain materials associated with higher or lower average prices?
- Dimensions: Do boat dimensions, such as length and width, have a significant impact on price? Are larger boats consistently more expensive?
- Market Interest: Is there a correlation between the number of views a boat listing receives and its price? Does higher interest translate to higher prices?
- Regional and Seasonal Variations: Are boat prices influenced by geographic location or seasonal factors?
